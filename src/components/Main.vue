          All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
        </p>

          In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.

          <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
          <p>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
          </p>
          <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The opening tag</li>
            <li>The closing tag</li>
            <li>The actual element</li>
            <li>

          <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
          <p>
            There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
            <li>
              To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix
            </li>
            <li>To build web applications</li>
            <li>To impress friends</li>
            <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
          </ul>
