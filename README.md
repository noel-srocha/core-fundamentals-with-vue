# HTML & CSS Fundamentals with Vue

This is my first attempt on building a Vue application from the ground up. It's promoted by __Jonas Scherdtmann__ who teaches in his [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/), to further my knowledge in front-end development while reviewing core concepts about HTML and CSS.
